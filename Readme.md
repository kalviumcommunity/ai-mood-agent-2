# Mood-Based Food & Restaurant Recommender AI

## Project Overview

This project develops an AI agent that recommends food items and restaurants based on the user's current mood. Leveraging advanced Generative AI techniques, the AI analyzes mood input (e.g., happy, stressed, sad) and provides personalized recommendations for meals or restaurants that align with that mood. The core of the system relies on prompt engineering, embeddings, and vector similarity to deliver relevant and context-aware suggestions.

## Features

*   **Mood Input Analysis:** Accepts natural language mood input from the user and interprets it to understand the emotional state.
*   **Food Recommendations:** Suggests specific dishes or food types that are known to complement or alleviate certain moods.
*   **Restaurant Recommendations:** Provides suggestions for nearby or popular restaurants that offer the recommended food or create an atmosphere suitable for the user's mood.
*   **Dynamic Prompting:** Utilizes dynamic prompt generation to tailor the LLM's instructions based on the user's current mood, ensuring highly relevant outputs.
*   **Advanced LLM Techniques:** Incorporates various prompting strategies including zero-shot, one-shot, multi-shot prompting, and chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance recommendation quality.
*   **Structured Output:** Ensures that recommendations are returned in a consistent, machine-readable format (e.g., JSON) for easy integration and processing.
*   **Function Calling:** Implements function calling to enable the LLM to interact with external tools, such as a restaurant search API or a database, to fetch more specific or real-time information.
*   **Vector Database & Embeddings:** Stores and retrieves food and restaurant data as high-dimensional embeddings. This allows for efficient similarity searches to find items that are semantically close to the user's mood or other preferences.
*   **Similarity Metrics:** Employs various vector similarity metrics (Cosine Similarity, Euclidean Distance, Dot Product) to calculate the relevance between mood embeddings and food/restaurant embeddings.
*   **Evaluation Framework:** Includes a robust evaluation pipeline with a dataset of test cases and a judge prompt to validate the quality and relevance of the AI's recommendations against expected results.
*   **LLM Parameter Control:** Demonstrates control over LLM generation parameters such as Temperature, Top P, Top K, and Stop Sequences to fine-tune the AI's creativity and output style.
*   **Token Logging:** Logs token usage for each AI call, providing insights into cost and efficiency.

## Technical Implementation

### Generative AI & Prompt Engineering

The project utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) (e.g., Google's Gemini, OpenAI's GPT) as the core recommendation engine. Prompt engineering is crucial for guiding the LLM to generate appropriate responses.

*   **System Prompt:** Establishes the AI's persona and overall goal.
*   **User Prompt:** Contains the user's mood input and specific request.
*   **Zero-shot Prompting:** Directly asks the LLM for recommendations without examples.
*   **One-shot Prompting:** Provides one example of input-output to guide the LLM.
*   **Multi-shot Prompting:** Offers several examples for more robust learning.
*   **Dynamic Prompting:** Modifies parts of the prompt based on the detected mood (e.g., "Since you're feeling happy, how about...").
*   **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Encourages the LLM to explain its reasoning process before providing the final recommendation, leading to more logical and transparent suggestions.

### Embeddings and Vector Database

*   **Embeddings:** Textual descriptions of food items, restaurants, and moods are converted into numerical vector representations (embeddings) using an embedding model. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.
*   **Vector Database:** A specialized database (e.g., ChromaDB, Pinecone, FAISS) is used to store these embeddings. This allows for fast and efficient similarity searches.
*   **Similarity Metrics:**
    *   **Cosine Similarity:** Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, indicating their directional similarity. Ideal for semantic similarity.
    *   **Euclidean Distance (L2 Distance):** Measures the straight-line distance between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space.
    *   **Dot Product Similarity:** A simpler measure related to the magnitude and angle of vectors.

### Evaluation Framework

*   **Evaluation Dataset:** A collection of mood inputs with corresponding expected food and restaurant recommendations.
*   **Judge Prompt:** A separate prompt used with an LLM to evaluate the quality, relevance, and adherence to mood of the recommendations generated by the primary recommender LLM.
*   **Testing Framework:** Automates the process of running test cases, comparing outputs, and reporting evaluation metrics.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mood-food-recommender.git
    cd mood-food-recommender
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

    ```
4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    # Add other API keys if needed (e.g., for restaurant search APIs)
    ```
5.  **Prepare Data:**
    Populate `data/food_items.json` and `data/restaurants.json` with sample data.

## Usage
